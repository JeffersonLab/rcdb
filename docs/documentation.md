# Documentation

The website documentation is automatically generated via GitHub Actions 
[.github/workflows/documentation.yml](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/rcdb/blob/master/.github/workflows/documentation.yml)
 and uploaded to GitHub Pages. 

- The C++ reference part is generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl)
- The main website is powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/)


## Docsify

Docsify is an open-source tool for generating documentation websites directly from Markdown files. 
It dynamically converts Markdown files into a website without the need for a build process.

- Docsify uses GFM (Git Flawored Markdown) with additional features such as possibility to include one document in another
- [Docsify markdown features](https://docsify.js.org/#/helpers?id=important-content)
- [Full markdown typography used in rcdb theme](https://jhildenbiddle.github.io/docsify-themeable/#/markdown)



### Running on local machine

To preview the documentation on local machine, you can open `./docs` folder in any server application. 
Here is a python one-liner that makes the site running at `localhost:3000`

```bash
# assuming current working directoy is rcdb/docs 
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

> On windows machines you may have to use `python` instead of `python3`



### Adding content

Any markdown file added to docs folder will be automatically rendered by docsify if correct link is given. 
A file `text.md` is displayed by a link `<domain>#/text.md`


Is accessible as:

```
# localhost (if run by server above): 
http://localhost:3000/#/developers-transition-guide.md

# GitHub pages when merged into master
https://jeffersonlab.github.io/rcdb/#/developers-transition-guide.md
```

### Menus

While new content may be seen right away, it is not automatically getting added to the side menu. 
To add links no new pages to left side menu, one has to edit `_sidebar.md`, which is pretty self explanatory. 

`_coverpage.md` is responsible for the cover page content (with gnomes as of 2024). 


### Writing documentation

Here are couple recommendations to the documentation writing: 


- Use subdirectories for a group of documents and topics. Such as `howto` or `jana1to2`
- Use low case with dashes `low-case-with-dashes.md` file names style. It is considered to be better for search engine parsers. 
- Put pictures into corresponding subfolder or if a picture has a global context, to docs/_media folder. Create _media subfolders as needed. 
- Always follow the document purpose. Think if document falls into `How-to`, `Tutorial`,  `Explanation/documentation` or `Reference guide`. 
  Don't mix them together (even if sometimes adding a bit of theory in tutorial seems tempting - don't do it!)
