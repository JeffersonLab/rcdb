# Installation

One can consider several levels of RCDB installations: users install RCDB to introspect the db 
or setup data updating scripts. Reconstruction frameworks in C++ or JAVA would like to build
RCDB API and use it. Developers and system administrators - install RCDB development database, 
install website on hosting etc. We can split installation into chapters: 

1. ***Python (library, command line interface, user GUI (local website))***
2. C++ library compilation - see C++ section
3. Java library compilation - see Java section
4. Development install (git clone, MySQL setup, server management) - see Development section


## Python

RCDB python library could be considered as the main client and introspection tool for RCDB. 

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade rcdb
```

RCDB available on [Python PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/rcdb-web/) after installation one has available:

- `rcdb` python lbrary
- `rcdb` command, to work with RCDB in terminal or 
- `rcdb web` command for running local website

You can test the installation (using HallD read only database as example):


```bash
export RCDB_CONNECTION="mysql://rcdb@hallddb.jlab.org/rcdb2"

# rcdb command
rcdb info

# rcdb local web interface
rcdb web 

# Python library
python -c "import rcdb"
```

### Further experimenting

We mentioned HalldDB readonly database. To test and experiment with writing values to DB 
it is recommended to use local single-file SQLite database first.

One can use `rcdb db init` command to create one and follow the instructions: 

```bash
rcdb -c sqlite:///mydb.sqlite db init
```

One can download HALLD sqlite database (autogenerated daily) here:
